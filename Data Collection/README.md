# Data Collection 
Data collection from any website is time taking. Extractiong table data can be done manualy or we can do it by algorithm. But challenge is to reduce time taken. And there are many other problems.

If we don't wnat to do it mannually then we have following options:
* ***Selenium*** is a powerful tool for controlling web browsers through programs and performing browser automation. It is functional for all browsers, works on all major OS and its scripts are written in various languages i.e ***Python, Java, C#, etc***.
* Python library ***Pandas*** can also be used for extracting tabular data from website.


**Given Website:** "https://www.iexindia.com/marketdata/areaprice.aspx" has many challenges. So, directly Pandas can't be used for extacting table data. I implemented program in ***Selenium***. https://github.com/Monu-Khicher-1/Forecasting/blob/main/Data%20Collection/data_collection.py this is final implementation in https://github.com/Monu-Khicher-1/Forecasting/blob/main/Data%20Collection/data_collection.py
